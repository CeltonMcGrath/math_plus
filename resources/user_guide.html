<p>Please note that you should only sign up for programs that are at an appropriate grade level for your student.  If you want to sign up for a program at a different level please contact our office first as refunds will not be provided for programs at an inappropriate level.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://mathplus.math.toronto.edu/account/site/cart.php">Cart</a> tab has programs you have selected. You can also delete programs not yet paid for. </p>
<p>If you have applied for and been successfully selected for a bursary you can add the code here.</p>
<p>Once you have selected a program and added it to your cart you will click <b>Proceed to Payment</b> to be taken to our Moneris payment page.  You are not registered for a program until you have paid and received an email confirmation from Moneris.</p>
